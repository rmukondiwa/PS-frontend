# Happy Accidents

PS-Frontend is the front-end for **Happy Accidents**, a dating app game built during the **Cube Rush Hackathon** at Duke University. The app used predictive systems to recommend subtle, organic encounters between users by tracking daily habits and movement patterns. Based on those insights, it suggested when and where users might "accidentally" run into potential matchesâ€”creating more authentic, serendipitous interactions. This prototype was designed and developed in under 24 hours and demoed live during the final showcase.
